    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>
    <p>Luné ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Luné mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Luné is designed with privacy in mind. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers.</p>
    <p>All your preferences and content — including your name, selected theme, favorite quotes, custom affirmations, and notification settings — are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> only. We have no access to this data.</p>

    <h2>2. Notifications</h2>
    <p>Luné offers optional daily affirmation notifications (up to 3 per day). If you choose to enable notifications during onboarding or in your device settings, the app schedules these reminders locally on your device using Apple's local notification system.</p>
    <p>The affirmation content shown in notifications is selected locally on your device. Morning notifications draw from motivational affirmations, afternoon from focus-oriented content, and evening from self-love affirmations. No personal data is transmitted as part of this process.</p>
    <p>You can disable notifications at any time through your device's Settings.</p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Luné offers optional premium subscriptions (monthly, yearly) and a one-time lifetime purchase. These transactions are processed entirely by <strong>Apple</strong> through the App Store and managed via <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, a third-party subscription management service.</p>
    <p>As part of subscription management, RevenueCat processes the following data: an anonymous app user ID, purchase history, device type, operating system version, and country (derived from App Store metadata). This data is used solely to verify and manage your subscription status. No personally identifiable information — such as your name, email address, or payment details — is shared with RevenueCat by our app. Payment is handled entirely by Apple.</p>
    <p>You can review RevenueCat's privacy practices at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Analytics & Tracking</h2>
    <p>Luné does <strong>not</strong> use any analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not collect usage data, device identifiers, or behavioral information.</p>

    <h2>5. Widgets</h2>
    <p>Luné offers home screen widgets that display affirmations. Widget data (current quote, theme preference, premium status) is shared between the app and the widget extension using a secure on-device App Group container. This data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Luné does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal data, the app is safe for users of all ages. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information, please contact us and we will address it promptly.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information is protected by your device's built-in security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID). We have no access to your data and cannot retrieve it remotely.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Luné uses the following third-party services, each governed by their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store</strong> — Payment processing and app distribution. <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — Subscription management. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your data:</p>

    <p><strong>For users in the European Economic Area (GDPR):</strong><br>
    Since Luné does not collect personal data directly, most GDPR rights apply to data held by our third-party services. You have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of any personal data processed by RevenueCat on our behalf. To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:luneapp.contact@gmail.com">luneapp.contact@gmail.com</a> and we will assist in facilitating your request with the relevant service.</p>

    <p><strong>For California residents (CCPA):</strong><br>
    Luné does not sell your personal information. We do not share personal information with third parties for advertising purposes. The only data processing that occurs is through RevenueCat for subscription management, as described in Section 3. You may contact us to request information about data collected on your behalf by our service providers.</p>

    <p><strong>For users in Turkey (KVKK):</strong><br>
    Luné operates in accordance with the Turkish Personal Data Protection Law (KVKK). As we do not collect or process personal data on our own servers, your KVKK rights primarily apply to data processed by our third-party service providers (Apple and RevenueCat). You may contact us at <a href="mailto:luneapp.contact@gmail.com">luneapp.contact@gmail.com</a> to request information or exercise your rights under KVKK.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
