    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 18, 2026</p>
    <p>Luné ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Luné mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Luné is designed with privacy in mind. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers.</p>
    <p>All your preferences and content — including your name, selected theme, favorite quotes, custom affirmations, and notification settings — are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> only. We have no access to this data.</p>

    <h2>2. Notifications</h2>
    <p>Luné offers optional daily affirmation notifications (up to 3 per day). If you choose to enable notifications during onboarding or in your device settings, the app uses <strong>Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)</strong> to deliver these reminders to your device.</p>
    <p>The affirmation content shown in notifications is selected locally on your device from your chosen category. No personal data is transmitted to us as part of this process. Apple's handling of notification delivery is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>You can disable notifications at any time through your device's Settings.</p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Luné offers optional premium subscriptions (monthly, yearly) and a one-time lifetime purchase. These transactions are processed entirely by <strong>Apple</strong> through the App Store and managed via <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, a third-party subscription management service.</p>
    <p>As part of subscription management, RevenueCat processes the following data: an anonymous app user ID, purchase history, device type, operating system version, and country (derived from App Store metadata). This data is used solely to verify and manage your subscription status. No personally identifiable information — such as your name, email address, or payment details — is shared with RevenueCat by our app. Payment is handled entirely by Apple. You can review RevenueCat's privacy policy at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Analytics & Tracking</h2>
    <p>Luné does <strong>not</strong> use any analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not collect usage data, device identifiers, or behavioral information.</p>

    <h2>5. Widgets</h2>
    <p>Luné offers home screen widgets that display affirmations. Widget data (current quote, theme preference, premium status) is shared between the app and the widget extension using a secure on-device App Group container. This data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Luné does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal data, the app is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information is protected by your device's built-in security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID).</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
